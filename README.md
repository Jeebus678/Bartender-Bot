# Bartender Bot
Bartender App running on an Arduino Mega, utilizing Adafruit_GFX GUI library and my SD Parser library. The build cost me about 200$ for all the materials and took over 40 hours of work to assemble, as well as about a month and a half developing the code.


#### Although this is version alpha, I am planning on building a much higher quality bartender in the future.
